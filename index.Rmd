Welcome! Here you can find information about me.

</p>

<p>

I am a recent PhD graduate and have a background in clinical and social psychology and sociology and have been involved in research since 2011 when I started off as a lab manager and research assistant. Broadly, my interests lie in research in general and mental health and social themes and issues, such as diversity, equity, and sociodemographic topics. I'm also interested in the effect of environmental and social issues on (mental) health, well-being, daily functioning, and access to care, especially in marginalized populations. My goal is to get involved in research or data analytics that has an applied, educational, scientific, and/or policy impact.

I am looking to start a new job in research, education, and/or data analytics in the area of (mental) health in the Randstad region of the Netherlands.
