## Education

**Doctoral Degree of Philosophy (PhD) from the Faculty of Medicine** 

Amsterdam UMC (location Academic Medical Center), University of Amsterdam | January 2019 - June 2023

Dissertation: *[Across Boundaries: Transdiagnostic and network approach in psychiatry](https://dare.uva.nl/search?field1=keyword;value1=chavez;docsPerPage=1;startDoc=6)*

My PhD project investigated the relationships between psychopathological symptoms, cognitive function, and psychological factors, such as self-esteem and existential concerns, using the transdiagnostic and network approaches. The aim was to gain insight into dimension- or symptom-level relationships and elucidate potential transdiagnostic processes within psychopathology. I used network analyses, mixed graphical modeling, and cross-lagged modeling to investigate my research questions.
