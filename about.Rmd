## Education

**PhD student from the Across Consortium** 

Amsterdam UMC (location Academic Medical Center), University of Amsterdam | January 2019 - June 2023

Dissertation: *[Across Boundaries: Transdiagnostic and network approach in psychiatry](https://dare.uva.nl/search?field1=keyword;value1=chavez;docsPerPage=1;startDoc=6)*

My PhD project investigated the relationships between psychopathological symptoms, cognitive function, and psychological factors, such as self-esteem and existential concerns, using the transdiagnostic and network approaches. The aim was to gain insight into dimension- or symptom-level rather than diagnostic-level relationships and elucidate potential transdiagnostic processes.

## Work Experience

**Research Coordinator** | Amsterdam UMC, Academic Medical Center | January 2018 - December 2022

I ran the day-to-day affairs of the Across study, such as administrative tasks, data management, scheduling, ordering supplies, and upkeep of research equipment and spaces. During my time, I updated protocols and research infrastructure to make them WMO, GDPR, and GCP compliant. I also began FAIRification of the study. After the first year of my coordinator position, I was offered my PhD position.

**Internship and Thesis Supervisor** | Amsterdam UMC, Academic Medical Center | January 2018 - May 2022

I guided interns through all stages of a master thesis from finding an appropriate research question to analyses and discussion and provided them with one-on-one supervision as well as team management. I trained them how to conduct research and created training protocols, handbooks, and explanation videos on tasks for my interns.

**Guest/Substitute Teacher** | School District of Lee County, Florida; Kelly Education Staffing, Polk County School District, Florida | September 2017 – December 2017; November 2014 - June 2015

I replaced teachers during their absence and worked at elementary and middle schools. I executed lesson plans provided by the absent teacher, successfully managed student behavior and implemented methods across subjects and grade levels. I quickly adapted to different classroom dynamics and changing circumstances, including unforeseen schedule changes and last-minute assignments.

**Mentor & Tutor** | Learning Resource Center, Mulberry Middle School, Florida |November 2014 - June 2015

I tutored migrant and low socioeconomic students with homework and projects on various academic topics. I also advised them on education and professional matters and counseled students on issues related to adolescence and migrant/low SES challenges based on my own lived experience.
