## Experience

**Research Coordinator** | Amsterdam UMC, Academic Medical Center | January 2018 - December 2022

I ran the day-to-day affairs of the Across study, such as administrative tasks, data management, scheduling, ordering supplies, and upkeep of research equipment and spaces. During my time, I updated protocols and research infrastructure to make them WMO, GDPR, and GCP compliant. I also began FAIRification of the study. After the first year of my coordinator position, I was offered my current PhD position.

**Internship and Thesis Supervisor** | Amsterdam UMC, Academic Medical Center | January 2018 - May 2022

I guided interns through all stages of a master thesis from finding an appropriate research question to analyses and discussion and provided them with one-on-one supervision as well as team management. I trained them how to conduct research and created training protocols, handbooks, and explanation videos on tasks for my interns.
